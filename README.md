# Professional Summary

I am a meticulous Software Developer with more than 12 years of professional experience working remotely from [*Colima, México*](https://goo.gl/maps/Dq3yZHkDxJMb3N3A6) (CST). I have worked for agencies, startups and large SaaS companies (mainly for the travel industry and related services) in distributed agile teams to create consumer products with a positive impact on revenue and conversion rates.

Proficient in **CSS** and **JavaScript** Frameworks with extensive knowledge of *accessibility standards*, *localization* techniques, *cross-browser* compatibility and *responsive* design. Write efficient, good performing and reusable code without sacrificing maintainability complemented by automated *E2E testing* and *unit tests* to ensure production readiness and avoid risks post-release.

My current stack involves **React**, **Node**, **TypeScript**, **REST**, and **GraphQL** as main development technologies which has allowed me to develop a wide variety of web applications ranging from simple *static pages* to *isomorphic* applications as well as consuming and providing *API's*, although I can quickly integrate with any technology stack. I also have experience using **Redux** as state management and some styling paradigms.
